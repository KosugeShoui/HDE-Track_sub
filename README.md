## Abstract
Infertility is a common problem, affecting approximately one in six adults worldwide. Several studies have
shown that the male factor is responsible for infertility in up to 50% of couples. Elaborate sperm analysis is
needed to solve this problem. Manual evaluation of sperm motility requires precise microscopic observation.
In addition, the rapid movement of sperm in the microscopic field of view requires a large amount of human
and time labor. To address this issue, the adoption of Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) systems
has been increasing in clinical settings as a replacement for manual evaluations conducted by experts.
To automate sperm analysis, it is necessary to detect and track target sperm from microscopic videos.
However, a baseline has not been established for an end-to-end model that performs sperm detection and
tracking simultaneously. To contribute to the automation of sperm evaluation, we propose HDE-Track, a
model that considers both the detection of blurry sperm and the movement of sperm.
Through experiments conducted using VISEM-Tracking(a human spermatozoa tracking dataset), HDETrack achieved 2.0% improvement in HOTA and 5.2% improvement in MOTA compared to the existing
model TransTrack. The proposed method, HDE-Track, contributes to the automation of sperm analysis by
integrating with conventional CASA systems. HDE-Track can serve as a stronger baseline for future research
on temporal modeling and Transformer-based sperm detection and tracking models.
